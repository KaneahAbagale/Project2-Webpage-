 <p>
    The year begun a good note, with a new job, relocating and getting to spend more time with my sisters.
    My new job as a cabin crew was amazing because I got the opportunity to embark on a new career journey. 
    Not even the licencial or stressful six week intensive training could steal this joy.
    I officially started flying on the 6th of January and it was amazing.

    I am a down-to-earth and dedicated young lady with a relentless commitment to meeting targets and learning new things. 
    I enjoy taking initiatives that contribute to gender equity and I am not afraid to assume responsibilities while encouraging 
    more females to join and take initiatives in STEM. I envision myself mentoring up-coming generations into Tech as well as encouraging 
    and helping businesses adopt cloud technologies.
